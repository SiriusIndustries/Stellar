/**
 * Provides a facility for managing and closing multiple {@link AutoCloseable} resources.
 * <p>
 * This class can be used as a lightweight alternative to nested {@code try-with-resources} blocks.
 * Resources are registered in a stack-like structure (LIFO order) via {@link #manage(AutoCloseable)},
 * and are closed in reverse order when {@link #close()} is invoked.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, this system works similarly to <em>arena allocation</em> strategies where resources
 * are grouped into a managed arena, and it is collectively torn down at the end of lifetime.
 * <p>
 * If any resource throws an exception on closing, the first exception is rethrown (and wrapped as a
 * {@link RuntimeException}, preventing unspecific catch blocks), and subsequent exceptions are added
 * to it as suppressed exceptions, preserving the full closure context.
