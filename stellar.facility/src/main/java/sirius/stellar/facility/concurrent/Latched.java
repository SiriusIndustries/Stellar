/**
 * A wrapper around a given object of type {@code T}, with methods to wait until it is available.
 * <p>
 * This is thread-safe, and the {@link Latched#set(Object)} method can be invoked from any thread;
 * once {@link Latched#release()} has been invoked, {@link Latched#get()} will return on every
 * thread waiting for it, even if the object is {@code null}; the control on when the object is
 * available is separate to the actual assignment of the object.
 * <p>
 * {@link Latched#toString()} returns a message that contains the locked object, whether the latch
 * has been released or not - it can potentially display {@code "null"}, but is entirely null-safe
 * and uses {@link String#valueOf(Object)} in order to obtain this value. The message will appear
 * as {@code Latched[object=*]}, where {@code *} is {@code String.valueOf(latched.reference.get())}.
 * <p>
 * {@link Latched#hashCode()} returns a hash code for the latched object if it has been set, or
 * zero if it has not (as {@link Objects#hashCode(Object)} is called).
 * <p>
 * {@link Latched#equals(Object)} will return true if this latched object is equal to itself, false
 * if the object it is compared to null, or true if the object it is compared to is another latched
 * object where the set object is deeply equal to this latched object's set object. The deep equality
 * is calculated with {@link Objects#deepEquals(Object, Object)}. If the latched object is still
 * locked, it will instead return false rather than trying to await the object's release as that
 * qualifies the lack of equality. This is checked with {@link Latched#locked()}, which in turn
 * invokes {@link CountDownLatch#getCount()} which may not be desirable behaviour.
