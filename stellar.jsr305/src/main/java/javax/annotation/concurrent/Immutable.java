/**
 * The class to which this annotation is applied is immutable. This means that
 * its state cannot be seen to change by callers. Of necessity this means that
 * all public fields are final, and that all public final reference fields refer
 * to other immutable objects, and that methods do not publish references to any
 * internal state which is mutable by implementation even if not by design.
 * Immutable objects may still have internal mutable state for purposes of
 * performance optimization; some state variables may be lazily computed, so
 * long as they are computed from immutable state and that callers cannot tell
 * the difference.
 * <p>
 * Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe; they may be passed between
 * threads or published without synchronization.
