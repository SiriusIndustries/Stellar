 * This was created instead of simply referencing all the dispatchers directly in order to
 * allow for contributions to be made more easily to eventually cover every single logging
 * facade / implementation (before facades were used) so that not a single library isn't
 * able to push logging output to {@link Logger}, though this violates the YAGNI rule.
 * <p>
 * It is a part of the public interface allowing people to respectively register their own
 * dispatchers given they are attempting to retrofit an unknown/proprietary logging system
 * that may be called across many internal packages.
