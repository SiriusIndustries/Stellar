/**
 * An enumerator that defines a set of standard logging levels that can be used to
 * control logging output. The levels are ordered and specified by ordered integers.
 * <p>
 * Essentially, {@link LoggerLevel#severity()} returns an integer value for the severity
 * of a given level. The higher the number, the more severe the logging is. More levels
 * could be added at any point in the future, so when debugging, the level should be
 * simply set to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} to include all messages. In production,
 * the level should be set to {@code 2}.
 * <p>
 * {@link LoggerLevel#ALL} and {@link LoggerLevel#OFF} are levels marked with severities
 * of {@link Integer#MIN_VALUE} and {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE} respectively. They should
 * never be logged out directly, and the {@link LoggerLevel#severity()} method never
 * called for them (they serve for routing dispatchers' levels).
