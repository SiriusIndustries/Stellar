/**
 * Represents an operation that takes place when a logger message is emitted.
 * <p>
 * Static methods are also available under this interface for obtaining default
 * implementations of the interface, such as for console logging.
 * <p>
 * When implementing this interface, the {@link LoggerMessage} object emitted when
 * collecting a message can have heavy assertions made against it and any heavy
 * operations needed to, e.g., publish messages through a distributed log, can be
 * done safely, as it is expected that collectors are always invoked asynchronously.
 * <p>
 * This means that performance is predictable, log ordering is never affected, and
 * the impact logging has on your application is negligible. However, it is still
 * suggested that {@link Collector#task(Callable)} is used to schedule a task if it
 * is heavy enough that mixing the task with other virtual threads is desirable, i.e.,
 * if it does any heavy I/O operations that could affect general performance of your
 * application.
