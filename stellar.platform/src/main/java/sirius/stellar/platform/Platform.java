/**
 * This class represents the central component of the framework facilitating
 * inversion-of-control and the management of dependencies within applications.
 * <p>
 * It provides an entrypoint that can be used by the application to achieve a
 * very opinionated startup process where the only classes in any given source
 * tree will be data models, singleton beans, controllers, views, etc.
 * <p>
 * Injecting this class into any given bean provides a lot of global metadata
 * about the current process. The static methods provided by this class are
 * only to be used to retro-fit applications written contrary to the paradigm
 * promoted by the use of this class, and their use should be avoided.
 * <p>
 * Here is a full list of provided beans in the inversion-of-control container:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link Platform} - An instance of this class which can be used to
 *         retrieve any global metadata about the current process, for example,
 *         the startup time using {@link Platform#startup()}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link Runtime} - Retrieved with {@link Runtime#getRuntime()}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link ExecutorService} - A virtual thread executor service that is
 *         created using {@link Executors#newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()}.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         {@link RandomGenerator} - {@link SecureRandom#SecureRandom()} is used
 *         to create the provided instance (prioritizing randomness) - if this is
 *         undesirable, a different instance could be provided in your own factory,
 *         then that retrieved directly, instead of this abstract interface, in
 *         order to use it.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Useful JMX beans, including:
 *         <ul>
 *     	       <li>{@link ClassLoadingMXBean}</li>
 *             <li>{@link CompilationMXBean}</li>
 *             <li>
 *                 {@link GarbageCollectorMXBean}s
 *                 (inject using a {@link List} or {@link Set})
 *             </li>
 *             <li>{@link MemoryMXBean}</li>
 *             <li>
 *                 {@link MemoryManagerMXBean}s
 *                 (inject using a {@link List} or {@link Set})
 *             </li>
 *             <li>
 *                 {@link MemoryPoolMXBean}s
 *                 (inject using a {@link List} or {@link Set})
 *             </li>
 *             <li>{@link OperatingSystemMXBean}</li>
 *             <li>{@link RuntimeMXBean}</li>
 *             <li>{@link ThreadMXBean}</li>
 *         </ul>

	 * The entrypoint that should be used if the framework is being used in full.
	 * <p>
	 * This will automatically create an inversion-of-control container and wire
	 * all dependencies using the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader}.
	 * <p>
	 * When this entrypoint is being used, the {@link Platform} class is available
	 * inside the container and can be injected into any wired beans. For example:
	 * <pre>{@code
	 *     @Component
	 *     class Example {
	 *
	 *         @Inject
	 *         Example(Platform platform) {
	 *             // ...
	 *         }
	 *     }
	 * }</pre>
	 * However, at the point in time in which the constructor would be invoked, only
	 * the instance methods against this class should be invoked (i.e., against the
	 * instance that is injected). Methods such as {@link Platform#scope()} should
	 * not be called as the scope has not finished being built. Should these methods
	 * be needed, they can be accessed in an instance method inside a given class
	 * annotated with {@link io.avaje.inject.PostConstruct}, as follows:
	 * <pre>{@code
	 *     // (omit class declaration, @Component, etc for brevity) ...
	 *     @PostConstruct
	 *     public void postConstruct(BeanScope scope) {
	 *         // ...
	 *     }
	 * }</pre>
	 * The {@link BeanScope} argument is provided here to demonstrate how the scope
	 * can be injected directly through the method as this is a common use case (though,
	 * an anti-pattern in most cases). However, it can be omitted, and any method
	 * simply annotated with {@link io.avaje.inject.PostConstruct} will be executed.
	 * <p>
	 * This also calls {@code Logger.collector(Collector.console())} to forward logging
	 * to console, as if this entrypoint is being used, that is most likely desirable
	 * behavior. If this is not desirable behavior, this entrypoint should not be used
	 * in favor of a domain-specific fix, eventually migrating to use the framework in
	 * full and allowing the logging system to collect logs to console as well.
	 * <p>
	 * Remaining on the topic of potential side effects, this method allows for a small
	 * amount of flexibility in the contract for the "arguments" parameter; not only is
	 * it using a declaration with varargs, but it also can be provided as null (which
	 * case it will simply be replaced with {@code new String[0]}). It should not
	 * contain null values within the array, however.
	 * <p>
	 * This functionality should not provide any benefit to applications conforming to
	 * well-executed paradigms, but is beneficial to retrofit applications that may have
	 * complex launch sequences that may call this method from a different context to the
	 * common Java Virtual Machine initialization; in any case, the contract here is very
	 * lenient and allows for any of these environments to be retrofitted, stating this as
	 * the application entrypoint.
