Sirius/Stellar
==============

	There are many available sources of documentation for users and contributors.
	Rendered source documentation is available in the "target" directory for any
	given module after building. https://stellar.sirius.cam houses the handbook.

	<!> PLEASE NOTE <!>
	===================

		-	The handbook is currently not public
		-	Release 1u1 is NOT READY YET!

	<!> HOWEVER <!>
	===============

		-	You can build this project and use stellar.logging & stellar.facility,
		in production, without too much worry about API changes. Functionality is
		stable and it is already being used at Sirius.
		-	You can use `stellarfeedbackdelegate@mechite.com` for support. More
		information about emails is below, read onwards...

Building
========

	More in-depth instructions are available in the handbook.
	However, the basic requirements are simple.

	The preferred environment includes Oracle GraalVM for Java 21 and the Apache
	Maven Daemon (mvnd), or any suitable distribution of Maven.

	Then, either the `package` or `install` goals (depending on if the library is
	to be used somewhere else, or just artifacts produced) can be used.

	For example, with `mvnd`, `mvnd install` can be used to install the produced
	packages into the local repository for use as a dependency, elsewhere, later.

Contributing
============

	Currently, in general, contributions are not accepted.
	However, you can submit patches to `stellarpatchdelegate@mechite.com`.
	Issues, bugs, etc can be submitted to `stellarfeedbackdelegate@mechite.com`.

	A response will always be provided to anything submitted to these addresses.

Licensing
=========

	While the project is licensed and will be licensed with CC BY-NC 4.0 for the
	foreseeable future, licenses may eventually be available for the general public.

	Special access can be granted to users and organizations by request.
	Responses will always be attempted within 24 hours, so licenses can be obtained fast.

	This can be obtained by emailing `stellarlegaldelegate@mechite.com` with the following
	information (* for required; please fill all fields using "N/A" for empty optionals):

		Name *
		Organization
		Role

		Description of use *
		Commercial use? (y/n) *

		Minimum license duration required (or N/A)
		Earliest required start date (or N/A)

	Given tolerable grounds, licenses will be offered free of charge to the majority of users.
